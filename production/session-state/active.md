# Active Session State

**Last Updated:** 2026-05-09
**Project Stage:** Pre-Production — Sprint 2 — Active

## Current Task

Sprint 2 opened with `S2-COMBAT-01`, the Gemini cross-vendor hotfix for init-only property preservation in `CombatActorStateTransitions`. The story is complete at implementation commit `5b8a017`; closure metadata is being finalized.

Next recommended: draft the Sprint 2 plan/status scaffold with `S2-COMBAT-01` listed retrospectively as story #1, then continue with the Sprint 1.5 close-out gates (`/smoke-check sprint`, `/team-qa sprint`, `/gate-check`) or the next Sprint 2 planning command Brian selects.

- ⚠️ World Structure GDD — parked revision item, not active Sprint 1.5 combat closure work. Full `/design-review design/gdd/world-structure.md` completed 2026-04-23 with verdict **MAJOR REVISION NEEDED** and scope signal **XL**. Six blocker groups: (1) transition contract contradiction, (2) memory residency model contradiction, (3) save/zone identity contradiction, (4) formula/registry validator-safety issues, (5) acceptance criteria not T1-gateable, (6) T1 offline "world kept moving" bridge underspecified. Review log created at [design/gdd/reviews/world-structure-review-log.md](../../design/gdd/reviews/world-structure-review-log.md).

- ✅ Inventory & Item Economy Open Questions section written 2026-04-26.
- ⚠️ Inventory & Item Economy full design review completed 2026-04-26 with verdict **NEEDS REVISION** and scope signal **XL**. Six blocker groups: (1) Save/Load first-save reverse-listing drift, (2) Inventory schema/id/hydration pre-spec gap, (3) F1/currency/vendor math gaps, (4) vendor transaction economy not closed, (5) future Combat / Death & Corpse Recovery / Faction Reputation criteria leaking into T1, (6) Layer 1 HUD / Inventory UI receiver not registered.
- ✅ Inventory blocker 1 repaired 2026-04-26: Save/Load now reverse-lists `InventoryFirstSaveMaterializer`; remaining blockers parked in [design/gdd/inventory-item-economy.md](../../design/gdd/inventory-item-economy.md) `INV-OQ-05` for future Inventory implementation pre-spec.
- 🧪 `/prototype combat-feel` started 2026-04-26. Tech choice locked to Unity 6.3 LTS standalone prototype under `prototypes/combat-feel/`, with 3-5 sequential pulls, at least one default med break between pulls 2 and 3, explicit success/failure criteria, and durable findings target `production/prototypes/combat-feel-report.md`.
- ✅ Combat-feel scripted mechanics smoke passed under locally installed Unity `6000.4.1f1` batchmode (not pinned `6000.3.x`): 5/5 scripted pulls, 97.1s combat, 41.9s downtime, 19.4s average pull, 1 med break, 9 Smites, 4 Heals, 0 unsafe pulls. Human feel playtest still required before verdict.
- ✅ Sprint 1.5 plan committed 2026-05-06 at `8885d2e`: [production/sprints/sprint-1-5.md](../sprints/sprint-1-5.md).
- ✅ Sprint 1.5 QA plan committed 2026-05-06 at `b6297b4`: [production/qa/plans/qa-plan-sprint-1-5-20260506.md](../qa/plans/qa-plan-sprint-1-5-20260506.md).
- ✅ Sprint 1.5 story `T1.5-COMBAT-00` closed via `/story-done` 2026-05-06 with verdict **COMPLETE WITH NOTES**. Commit `c2487fc` lands D013 and ADR-0006 as Proposed.

## Files Being Worked On

- **Active:** Sprint 2 planning/status scaffold pending; [production/stories/s2-combat-01-fix-init-only-property-preservation.md](../stories/s2-combat-01-fix-init-only-property-preservation.md) is complete.
- Combat Feel Prototype: [prototypes/combat-feel/](../../prototypes/combat-feel/) — pinned-engine headline pass complete; prototype code remains throwaway evidence artifact.
- Combat Feel Prototype README: [prototypes/combat-feel/README.md](../../prototypes/combat-feel/README.md)

- .claude/agents/unity-specialist.md (Version Awareness section added)
- DECISIONS.md (D006 appended)

## Key Decisions Made

- **Engine**: Unity 6.3 LTS with C# (decided during /setup-engine) — FishNet planned for Tier 2+ netcode
- **Review mode**: Lean — director-gates skipped this session; targeted `/code-review 960a148` ran before closure and its provenance finding was fixed by `caea662`.
- **Visual identity locked**: "Every visual element earns its place through weight and age, not spectacle" + 3 supporting principles
- **Two-layer UI**: Layer 1 abstract practical HUD + Layer 2 fully diegetic world information
- T1-COMBAT-09c closed the player death payload stub and first held-policy feel-review artifact at `production/qa/combat/feel-review-09c-player-death.md`; human qualitative death-moment playtest remains pending as a Sprint 1.5 carryover.
- T1-COMBAT-10 closed the profiled evidence loop and surfaced quantitative combat-feel gaps.
- T1-COMBAT-11 is closed; Sprint 1.5 Must Have stories are 7/7 done.
- `T1.5-COMBAT-05` is closed; Sprint 1.5 Must Have stories are 7/7 complete.
- `AbilityResolvedEvent` remains `ManaSpent`-only after the physical resource split.
- ADR-0003 / D009 status metadata cleanup is closed.
- `H-CCOM-F2B` fixture extremes are validated by `T1-COMBAT-01`; seeded melee formula execution is validated by `T1-COMBAT-04`.
- Creature / Enemy AI still owns actual return-to-anchor movement and NavMeshAgent behavior.
- Inventory & Item Economy is intentionally parked after review.

## Next Skill to Run

- **Draft Sprint 2 plan/status scaffold and list `S2-COMBAT-01` retrospectively as story #1.**
- Later: run Sprint 1.5 close-out gates (`/smoke-check sprint`, `/team-qa sprint`, `/gate-check`) before advancing the project stage.
- Later: run Inventory implementation pre-spec to close `INV-OQ-05`, then rerun `/design-review design/gdd/inventory-item-economy.md --depth full`.

## Session Extract — /story-done 2026-05-09 (T1.5-COMBAT-05)

- Story: [production/stories/t1-5-combat-05-profiled-rerun-evidence-summary.md](../stories/t1-5-combat-05-profiled-rerun-evidence-summary.md) - T1.5-COMBAT-05 Profiled Rerun + Slice Evidence Summary.
- Verdict: COMPLETE.
- Criteria: 6/6 passing; `QA-05-01` through `QA-05-06` all have file:line evidence in the story completion notes and verification summary.
- Evidence: [tests/evidence/T1.5-COMBAT-05/verification.md](../../tests/evidence/T1.5-COMBAT-05/verification.md) records the harness rerun, fixture update, regression pass, hygiene gates, and provenance chain. [tests/evidence/T1.5-COMBAT-05/profiled-combat-slice.jsonl](../../tests/evidence/T1.5-COMBAT-05/profiled-combat-slice.jsonl) records all five required scenarios.
- Implementation commits: `960a148` is the implementation and metric-capture commit. `caea662` is the provenance-fix follow-up and current `origin/main` head.
- State updates: story status set to Complete; `production/sprint-status.yaml` marks `T1.5-COMBAT-05` done, records 7/7 Sprint 1.5 stories done, and updates `head` to `caea662`.
- Tech debt logged: None.
- Carried forward: human qualitative death-moment playtest pending for the slice review; `AbilityResolvedEvent.ManaSpent`-only payload semantics; QA-02-01 cooldown/global-recovery wording.
- Next recommended: `/smoke-check sprint`.

## Session Extract — /story-done 2026-05-09 (S2-COMBAT-01)

- Story: [production/stories/s2-combat-01-fix-init-only-property-preservation.md](../stories/s2-combat-01-fix-init-only-property-preservation.md) - S2-COMBAT-01 Fix Init-Only Property Preservation in CombatActorState Transitions.
- Verdict: COMPLETE WITH NOTES.
- Criteria: 5/5 passing; `S2-01-01` through `S2-01-05` all covered by unit tests and verification evidence.
- Evidence: [tests/evidence/S2-COMBAT-01/verification.md](../../tests/evidence/S2-COMBAT-01/verification.md) records implementation provenance, local gates, T1 negative-scope scan, and deferred Gemini-review items.
- Implementation commit: `5b8a017` fixes the three manual transition-copy paths and adds four regression tests.
- Code review: `/code-review 5b8a017` returned APPROVED WITH SUGGESTIONS from code and QA agents; no blocking findings.
- State updates: story status set to Complete; `production/sprint-status.yaml` intentionally unchanged because Sprint 1.5 is closed and no Sprint 2 status file exists yet.
- Tech debt logged: None.
- Carried forward: include `S2-COMBAT-01` retrospectively as story #1 when Sprint 2 plan/status scaffolding is drafted; optional future test polish can make the init-only preservation assertion reflection-driven from the allowlist.
- Next recommended: draft Sprint 2 plan/status scaffold, or run Sprint 1.5 close-out gates if Brian chooses that sequencing.
