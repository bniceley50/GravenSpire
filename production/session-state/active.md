# Active Session State

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-22
**Project Stage:** Pre-Production — Design

## Current Task

Design of MVP system GDDs for Gravespire.

## Status

- ✓ Brainstorm complete → [design/gdd/game-concept.md](../../design/gdd/game-concept.md)
- ✓ Engine configured → Unity 6.3 LTS + C# + URP (FishNet planned for Tier 2+)
- ✓ Art bible complete → [design/art/art-bible.md](../../design/art/art-bible.md) (9/9 sections, Lean mode, AD-ART-BIBLE skipped)
- ✓ Systems mapped → [design/gdd/systems-index.md](../../design/gdd/systems-index.md) (33 systems, 26 MVP)
- Next: Author per-system GDDs in dependency order, starting with Foundation layer

## Files Being Worked On

- Game concept: [design/gdd/game-concept.md](../../design/gdd/game-concept.md)
- Art bible: [design/art/art-bible.md](../../design/art/art-bible.md)
- Systems index: [design/gdd/systems-index.md](../../design/gdd/systems-index.md)
- CLAUDE.md (Technology Stack + Engine Version Reference)
- .claude/docs/technical-preferences.md (Unity 6.3 LTS + C# + URP + full specialist routing)
- docs/engine-reference/unity/VERSION.md (updated with post-May-2025 API gaps)
- .claude/agents/unity-specialist.md (Version Awareness section added)

## Key Decisions Made

- **Engine**: Unity 6.3 LTS with C# (decided during /setup-engine) — FishNet planned for Tier 2+ netcode
- **Review mode**: Lean — director-gates (CD-PILLARS, AD-CONCEPT-VISUAL, AD-ART-BIBLE, TD-FEASIBILITY, TD-SYSTEM-BOUNDARY, PR-SCOPE, CD-SYSTEMS) skipped this session
- **Visual identity locked**: "Every visual element earns its place through weight and age, not spectacle" + 3 supporting principles (Stillness Is The Signal / Faction Before Fantasy / The Beautiful And The Wrong)
- **Two-layer UI**: Layer 1 abstract practical HUD + Layer 2 fully diegetic world information (faction board, dialogue panels on faction-specific paper, personal journal)
- **Onboarding**: Sister Elara AI companion mentors new players by behavior — no tutorial text. MVP-critical system.
- **Scope staging**: 4 tiers. Tier 1 MVP = single-player vertical slice (Cleric + 1 haunt + 1 faction + 1 city hub). Tier 2 = co-op alpha. Tier 3 = persistent small-server beta. Tier 4 = full vision.

## Open Questions / Flags

- Technical-artist validation items accumulated in art bible (URP SSS cost model, decal projector perf, camera-stack isolation for corpse-run desat, GPU instancing behavior, etc.) — consolidated in art-bible.md Document Status header
- Mana-restore 1:1 linear fill depends on med-break mechanics (not yet specced in combat GDD)
- Zone definition = Addressable streaming group boundary; `unity-addressables-specialist` must configure streaming groups
- 26 MVP systems is large scope for a solo first-time dev — every design decision should keep asking "is this actually needed for Tier 1?"

## Next Skill to Run

- `/design-system [system-name]` to author the first per-system GDD. Design order in [systems-index.md](../../design/gdd/systems-index.md) §Recommended Design Order — Foundation layer first (World Structure → Save/Load → Menus & Settings → NPC System), then Combat Core (the core hypothesis).
- OR `/map-systems next` to auto-select the highest-priority undesigned system.
