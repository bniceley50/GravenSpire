# Balance Check

Analyze balance data, formulas, and design constraints for outliers, degenerate strategies, economy breakpoints, and progression problems.

## 0. Execution Contract

### 0.1 Invocation and autonomy

Supported modes:

- system-name: focus on one balancing domain
- path-to-data-file: analyze a specific data/config file
- blank: infer likely balance surfaces

This is a read-only skill. It may inspect files and run safe read-only diagnostics when Bash is allowed, but it must not create, edit, move, delete, rename, stage, commit, tag, deploy, publish, or update project state.

### 0.2 Path safety

All user-supplied paths must be repository-relative. Reject absolute paths, paths containing `..`, and paths outside the expected project roots for this skill. Normalize paths before reading or writing.

### 0.8 Missing-file behavior

| Situation | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Primary source missing | Continue only if the skill can infer a narrower safe scope; otherwise stop with the exact missing file/folder. |
| Referenced artifact missing | Record as a gap or blocker instead of inventing content. |
| Existing target file present | Not applicable; this skill does not write. |
| Ambiguous scope | Choose the smallest evidence-backed scope; ask only if two or more scopes are equally plausible. |
| Contradictory sources | Prefer explicit status/source-of-truth documents over generated reports; list the contradiction in the output. |

## 1. Discover Context

Read only the sources needed for the requested scope. Start with indexes, manifests, registries, and status files before reading large documents.

Primary sources:

- design/gdd/**/*.md
- data/**
- config/**
- assets/data/**
- docs/architecture/**
- production/playtests/**

Discovery rules:

1. Prefer canonical source-of-truth files over generated reports.
2. Use `Glob` and `Grep` before reading large files.
3. Keep a source list for the final report or artifact.
4. When many files match, read the most relevant 5 to 10 first and summarize the rest as candidates.
5. Treat missing or draft-status dependencies as blockers, not as approval to invent content.

## 2. Build the Working Model

Use the discovered evidence to build a concise working model before producing output.

1. Identify formulas, tunable values, progression tables, rewards, costs, timers, damage values, drop rates, and economy sinks/sources.
2. Compare implementation data against design-stated targets and expected player progression.
3. Compute qualitative ratios and simple derived metrics directly from visible values; do not invent simulation results.
4. Flag outliers, dominant strategies, dead choices, exploits, and unsupported difficulty spikes.
5. Return actionable tuning recommendations with confidence levels.

Classification rules:

- **Blocking**: prevents safe implementation, review, release, or downstream skill execution.
- **High**: likely to cause rework, wrong implementation, invalid QA, or broken traceability.
- **Medium**: weakens handoff quality but can be resolved during normal follow-up.
- **Low**: cleanup, clarity, or optional improvement.

## 3. Produce the Read-Only Report

Return the report in chat. Do not write files. If a durable report would be useful, recommend the appropriate write-capable skill or command instead of creating it.

Required report sections:

- Scope
- Input files
- Balance model
- Outliers
- Degenerate strategies
- Economy risks
- Recommended tuning queue

## 4. Validation

1. Check that every conclusion cites or names a repository source.
2. Check that all blockers have a concrete next action.
3. Check that proposed writes stay within the declared output paths.
4. Check that no writes or state changes were performed.

Stop conditions:

- No blocking stop condition was encountered.

## 5. Final Response

End with a concise verdict, prioritized findings, evidence sources, and recommended next command. Do not imply that any files were changed.
